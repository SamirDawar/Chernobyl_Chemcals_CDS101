## 1. Dataset

**Dataset Name: Chernobyl Chemical Radiation / CSV / Country Data**  
**Source / Platform: Kaggle**  

**Short Description:**  
- This dataset contains radiation measurements after The Chernobyl Incident. Looking at three isotopes, across varying dates in different European countries, and specific cities.
- With the main variables of radiation measurements being the three isotopes which are Iodine-131 (I-131), Caesium-134 (Cs-134), and Caesium-137 (Cs-137).
- This dataset contains 9 rows, and approximately 2038 columns.
- As for it's relevance, The Chernobyl Incident is considered to be the worst nuclear disaster in history, based on cost and casualties caused by the accident. Not only that, Several other European countries beside the Soviet Union were affected by it, due to a massive atmospheric transfer of radioactive material. Highlighting a point of interest on how drastic these effects were, across multiple countries, cities, and communities.

## 3. Research Question

Write 1–2 clear, specific, data-driven questions you want to answer.

**Main research question:**

> _How did radiation levels of I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137 vary across different countries after the Chernobyl disaster?_

**Optional secondary question(s):**

> _List any additional questions here._

## 4. Modeling Approach / Models Used

Describe what you plan to do analytically.

- Type of task (check all that apply):
  - [ ] Exploratory analysis only  
  - [ ] Regression (predicting a numeric value)  
  - [ ] Classification (predicting categories/labels)  
  - [ ] Clustering / unsupervised patterns  
  - [ ] Other (describe)

**Planned models / methods:**

Examples:  
- Linear regression, logistic regression  
- Decision tree (if allowed), k-means  
- Baseline model (e.g., majority class, mean predictor)

**Planned evaluation metrics:**

Examples:  
- Regression: RMSE, MAE, \(R^2\)  
- Classification: accuracy, precision/recall, F1, confusion matrix

## 5. Expected Results

What do you expect to find? It’s okay if this changes later.

- Bullet point 1 (e.g., “We expect feature X to be a strong predictor of Y.”)  
- Bullet point 2  
- Bullet point 3  

---

## 6. Potential Challenges (Optional)

- What might be difficult? (missing data, noisy labels, small sample size, etc.)  
- How might you handle or mitigate these issues?
